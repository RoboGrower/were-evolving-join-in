ROBO GROWER IS EVLOLVING - JOIN IN


Robo Grower is currently devloping the first generation of a 4 wheel self-propelled robotic platform that drives and synchroizes the operation of a CNC Agricultural Controller.

Aspects of our software come as as a friendly fork inspired by Farmbots current commitment to the exclusive use of tracks to move CNC Agricultural Controllers.   

We envision a future where small and medium sized farms are run by self-propelled autonomous robotic growing machines and hence the birth of the Robo Grower movement.
