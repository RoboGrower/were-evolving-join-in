Robo Grower is Evolving Join in


Robo Grower is a 4 wheel self-propelled robotic platform to drive a CDC Agricultural Controller.


Aspects of our software come as as a friendly fork inspired by Farmbots current commitment to the exclusive use of tracks to transport CDC Agricultural Controllers.   

We envision a future where small and medium sized farms are run by self-propelled autonomous robotic growing machines and hence the birth of the Robo Grower movement.
